# Movies Dataset Rating Prediction

This repository contains my work on a movies dataset where I explored different machine learning and neural network approaches to predict movie ratings.

In this project, I worked with both raw and cleaned versions of the dataset, implemented multiple models, and saved the trained model for future predictions.

The main objective of this project is to **predict movie ratings** based on available movie-related features.

## About the Dataset
The movies dataset is a structured (tabular) dataset containing information related to movies such as:
- Genre
- Runtime
- Budget
- Revenue
- Popularity
- Other numerical and categorical features

The target variable in this project is **Rating**, which is a continuous numerical value.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Worked with both uncleaned and cleaned versions of the dataset
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format
- Prepared the final dataset for modeling

---

### 2. Model Implementations
Multiple models were implemented to compare performance:

- **Neural Network (NN)** for regression  
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
- Traditional machine learning preprocessing techniques  

This helped in understanding how different models behave on the same dataset.

### 3. Model Saving
- The trained model was saved using a pickle file
- This allows predictions to be made without retraining the model

---

## Objective
To analyze movie-related features and predict the expected movie rating using regression-based models.

---

## Results
- Models were evaluated using regression metrics
- Performance comparison was done between Neural Network and SVR
- This project helped understand regression problems in machine learning

---

## What I Learned
- Handling real-world movie datasets
- Difference between classification and regression problems
